# gym-booking-app

This is a simple app for booking the gym in UCD without having to spam refresh 
in an attempt to get a slot.

Features
* Hot reloading on both processes using TypeScript compiler API (./builder)
* React frontend
* Headless Chrome used on main process to get around CORS without using an API

To-Do
* Implement Date Picker
* Connect to REST backend instead of using Puppeteer (makes bundle size enormous)
* Don't hardcode student number :p
